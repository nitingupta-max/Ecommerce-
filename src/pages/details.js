            A key objective is engaging digital marketing customers and allowing
            them to interact with the brand through servicing and delivery of
            digital media. Information is easy to access at a fast rate through
            the use of digital communications. Users with access to the Internet
            can use many digital mediums, such as Facebook, YouTube, Forums, and
            Email etc.<br></br>
            <br></br>
            Through Digital communications it creates a Multi-communication
            channel where information can be quickly exchanged around the world
            by anyone without any regard to whom they are.[28] Social
            segregation plays no part through social mediums due to lack of face
            to face communication and information being wide spread instead to a
            selective audience.
